The Python `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero, regardless of whether it is positive or negative.

The `abs()` function can be used on integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers. If the argument to `abs()` is a complex number, it will return the magnitude of the number.

Here is a simple example of how to use the `abs()` function:

```python
import math

# Calculate the absolute value of an integer
print(abs(-10))  # 10

# Calculate the absolute value of a floating-point number
print(abs(3.14))  # 3.14

# Calculate the absolute value of a complex number
print(abs(complex(1, 2)))  # 2.23606797749979
```

The `abs()` function can also be used to calculate the distance between two numbers on the number line. For example, the following code calculates the distance between the numbers `-5` and `10`:

```python
distance = abs(-5 - 10)
print(distance)  # 15
```

The `abs()` function is a very useful function in Python, and it has many applications in mathematics, science, and engineering.

The `abs()` function in Python is a built-in function that returns the absolute value of a number. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction.

Here is an example of how to use the `abs()` function in Python:

```python
# Example 1: Using abs() with integers
num1 = -10
num2 = 20

abs_num1 = abs(num1)
abs_num2 = abs(num2)

print(f"The absolute value of {num1} is {abs_num1}")
print(f"The absolute value of {num2} is {abs_num2}")
```

Output:
```
The absolute value of -10 is 10
The absolute value of 20 is 20
```

In this example, we first define two variables `num1` and `num2`, which are integers. We then use the `abs()` function to calculate their absolute values and store the results in `abs_num1` and `abs_num2`. Finally, we print out the absolute values.

Keep in mind that `abs()` can also be used with floating-point numbers:

```python
# Example 2: Using abs() with floating-point numbers
float_num1 = -7.5
float_num2 = 3.14

abs_float_num1 = abs(float_num1)
abs_float_num2 = abs(float_num2)

print(f"The absolute value of {float_num1} is {abs_float_num1}")
print(f"The absolute value of {float_num2} is {abs_float_num2}")
```

Output:
```
The absolute value of -7.5 is 7.5
The absolute value of 3.14 is 3.14
```

In this example, we use the `abs()` function with floating-point numbers `float_num1` and `float_num2`, and then print out their absolute values.

The `abs()` function is very useful when you want to ignore the sign of a number and only focus on its magnitude.
