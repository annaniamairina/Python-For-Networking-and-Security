The `classmethod()` function in Python is a built-in method that is used to define a class method. A class method is a method that is bound to the class and not the instance of the class. It takes the class itself as its first argument, conventionally named `cls`, rather than an instance of the class.

Here's an example of how to use `classmethod()`:

```python
class MyClass:
    class_variable = "I am a class variable"

    def __init__(self, value):
        self.instance_variable = value

    @classmethod
    def class_method(cls, x):
        print(f"Calling the class method with argument {x}")
        print(f"Accessing class variable: {cls.class_variable}")

# Creating an instance of the class
obj = MyClass("I am an instance variable")

# Calling the class method on the class itself (not on an instance)
MyClass.class_method(10)

# Calling the class method on an instance (it works, but it's less common)
obj.class_method(20)
```

Output:
```
Calling the class method with argument 10
Accessing class variable: I am a class variable
Calling the class method with argument 20
Accessing class variable: I am a class variable
```

In this example:

- We define a class `MyClass` with a class variable (`class_variable`) and an instance variable (`instance_variable`).
- We create an instance of the class named `obj`.
- We define a class method `class_method` using the `@classmethod` decorator. The method takes `cls` as its first parameter, representing the class itself.
- We call the class method both on the class itself (`MyClass.class_method(10)`) and on an instance of the class (`obj.class_method(20)`).

Class methods are often used for operations that involve the class itself, rather than instances of the class. They can be used to create alternative constructors, perform class-level operations, or access class-level variables.
