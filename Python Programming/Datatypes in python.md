Python is a dynamically typed language, which means you don't need to declare the data type of a variable explicitly. The interpreter determines the data type based on the value you assign. Here are some common data types in Python:

1. **Numeric Types:**
   - `int`: Integer data type (e.g., 5, -10, 100)
   - `float`: Floating-point data type (e.g., 3.14, -0.5, 2.0)

2. **Text Type:**
   - `str`: String data type (e.g., "Hello, Python!", '42', "123")

3. **Boolean Type:**
   - `bool`: Boolean data type (True or False)

4. **Sequence Types:**
   - `list`: Ordered, mutable collection (e.g., [1, 2, 3])
   - `tuple`: Ordered, immutable collection (e.g., (1, 2, 3))
   - `range`: Represents a range of numbers (e.g., range(0, 5))

5. **Mapping Type:**
   - `dict`: Dictionary, a collection of key-value pairs (e.g., {'name': 'John', 'age': 30})

6. **Set Types:**
   - `set`: Unordered collection of unique elements (e.g., {1, 2, 3})
   - `frozenset`: Immutable version of a set (e.g., frozenset({1, 2, 3}))

7. **Sequence Type (Text-like):**
   - `str`: String data type also falls under the sequence category, as it's a sequence of characters.

8. **Binary Types:**
   - `bytes`: Immutable sequence of bytes (e.g., b'hello')
   - `bytearray`: Mutable sequence of bytes
   - `memoryview`: Used to work directly with the memory of an object

9. **None Type:**
   - `None`: Represents the absence of a value or a null value (similar to null in other languages)

Python also supports more advanced data types through modules, such as:

- **Datetime Types:**
  - `datetime`: Represents a date and time combination
  - `date`: Represents a date (year, month, day)
  - `time`: Represents a time (hour, minute, second)

- **Custom Classes:**
  - You can define your own classes and create objects with custom data types.

- **Modules for Scientific Computing:**
  - `numpy`: Provides support for arrays and matrices (used extensively in scientific computing)
  - `pandas`: Provides data structures for efficiently working with large datasets

Each data type has its own characteristics and methods associated with it. Python's versatility in handling different data types makes it suitable for a wide range of applications, from simple scripting to complex data analysis and machine learning.
