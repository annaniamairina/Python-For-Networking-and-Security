The `os.makedirs()` function in Python is used to create directories recursively, meaning it can create parent directories as needed to create the desired directory structure. This function is particularly useful when you need to ensure that a complete directory path exists before creating a new directory.

Here's the basic syntax of `os.makedirs()`:

```python
import os

# Create directory and its parent directories if they don't exist
os.makedirs(path, mode=0o777, exist_ok=False)
```

- `path`: The directory path you want to create, including any necessary parent directories.
- `mode`: The permission mode for the created directories. The default value is `0o777`, which gives full read, write, and execute permissions.
- `exist_ok`: If set to `True`, the function won't raise an error if the directory already exists. If set to `False` (the default), an error will be raised if the directory exists.

Here's an example of using `os.makedirs()` to create a directory and its parent directories:

```python
import os

path = "my_directory/nested_directory/subdirectory"
os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)
```

In this example, the directory structure "my_directory/nested_directory/subdirectory" will be created, including any necessary parent directories. The `exist_ok` parameter is set to `True`, so if the directories already exist, no error will be raised.

Remember to handle permissions and errors appropriately based on your use case. The `os.makedirs()` function is commonly used when you need to ensure a specific directory structure exists before performing file I/O or other operations.
