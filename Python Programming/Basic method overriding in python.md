Method overriding is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its parent class. In Python, method overriding is achieved by defining a method in the subclass with the same name as the method in the parent class.

Here's a basic example of method overriding in Python:

```python
class Parent:
    def show(self):
        print("This is the Parent class")

class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        print("This is the Child class")

# Create instances
parent_obj = Parent()
child_obj = Child()

# Call the overridden method
parent_obj.show()  # Output: This is the Parent class
child_obj.show()   # Output: This is the Child class
```

In this example:

- The `Parent` class defines a method named `show()`.
- The `Child` class inherits from the `Parent` class and overrides the `show()` method with its own implementation.

When you call the `show()` method on an instance of the `Child` class, the overridden method in the `Child` class is invoked, and its implementation is executed.

It's important to note that method overriding applies to instance methods. If you want to call the overridden method of the parent class from the child class, you can use the `super()` function:

```python
class Child(Parent):
    def show(self):
        super().show()  # Call the overridden method from the parent class
        print("This is an additional message from the Child class")

child_obj = Child()
child_obj.show()
```

Output:

```
This is the Parent class
This is an additional message from the Child class
```

Method overriding allows you to customize the behavior of methods in subclasses, providing a way to achieve polymorphism and code reuse in object-oriented programming.
