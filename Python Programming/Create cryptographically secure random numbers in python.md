To generate cryptographically secure random numbers in Python, you should use the `secrets` module, which is specifically designed for generating secure random values. This module provides functions for generating random numbers, tokens, and other secure data.

Here's how you can generate cryptographically secure random integers using the `secrets` module:

```python
import secrets

# Generate a cryptographically secure random integer between a range (inclusive)
random_integer = secrets.randbelow(100)  # Generates a random integer from 0 to 99
print("Random Integer:", random_integer)
```

Here's an example of generating a cryptographically secure random hexadecimal string:

```python
import secrets

# Generate a cryptographically secure random hexadecimal string
random_hex = secrets.token_hex(16)  # Generates a 32-character hexadecimal string
print("Random Hex:", random_hex)
```

In this example, `secrets.token_hex(16)` generates a random hexadecimal string with a length of 32 characters (16 bytes).

The `secrets` module relies on the operating system's random number generator and is considered more secure for cryptographic purposes than the `random` module, which is designed for non-cryptographic use cases.

It's important to note that the `secrets` module is available in Python 3.6 and later versions. If you're using an older version of Python, you won't have access to this module. In that case, consider upgrading to a newer version of Python or exploring third-party libraries that offer similar functionality.
