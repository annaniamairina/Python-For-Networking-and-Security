To retrieve values from an SQLite database in Python and handle errors, you can use the `sqlite3` module along with proper error-handling techniques. Here's an example of how to fetch values from a database and handle errors:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
cursor = conn.cursor()

try:
    # Fetch data from the table
    cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users")
    rows = cursor.fetchall()

    # Process fetched data
    for row in rows:
        print("ID:", row[0])
        print("Name:", row[1])
        print("Age:", row[2])
        print("")

except sqlite3.Error as e:
    print("An error occurred:", e)

finally:
    # Close the connection
    conn.close()
```

In this example:

1. We import the `sqlite3` module and connect to the SQLite database using `sqlite3.connect()`.

2. Within the `try` block, we execute a `SELECT` query using `cursor.execute()` to fetch data from the `users` table.

3. The fetched data is stored in the `rows` variable using `cursor.fetchall()`.

4. We then process and print each row of data.

5. Inside the `except` block, we catch any `sqlite3.Error` that might occur during database operations. We print an error message that includes the specific error message provided by SQLite.

6. The `finally` block ensures that the database connection is closed, regardless of whether an error occurred or not.

Error handling is crucial to handle unexpected situations that may arise during database operations. In this example, we catch the `sqlite3.Error` exception, which covers a wide range of potential errors that can occur when working with an SQLite database. Depending on your specific use case, you might handle different exceptions or errors more granularly.

Make sure to replace `'mydatabase.db'` with the actual path to your SQLite database file, and adjust the SQL query and table names according to your database schema.
