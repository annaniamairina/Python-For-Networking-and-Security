SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, and self-contained relational database management system (RDBMS) that does not require a separate server process. It's included as a standard library in Python, making it an excellent choice for small-scale database applications and applications that need an embedded database.

Here are some key features of SQLite that make it suitable for use in Python without a separate server process:

1. **Serverless Architecture:** SQLite operates as a library linked directly into your application. There is no separate server process running; the database is accessed directly from your Python code.

2. **Self-Contained:** An SQLite database is a single file on the filesystem. This file contains the entire database schema, data, and metadata. This makes it easy to distribute and manage your database.

3. **Lightweight:** SQLite is designed to be lightweight and efficient, making it well-suited for applications with moderate database requirements.

4. **Zero Configuration:** Since there is no separate server process, you don't need to install or configure a database server. Just import the `sqlite3` module in Python and start working with databases.

5. **Cross-Platform:** SQLite databases are platform-independent, allowing you to create and access databases on various operating systems without modification.

Here's a simple example of using SQLite in Python:

```python
import sqlite3

# Connect to or create a database file
conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')

# Create a cursor
cursor = conn.cursor()

# Create a table
cursor.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users
                (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, name TEXT, age INTEGER)''')

# Insert data into the table
cursor.execute("INSERT INTO users (name, age) VALUES (?, ?)", ("Alice", 30))

# Commit the changes and close the connection
conn.commit()
conn.close()
```

In this example, the `sqlite3` module is used to create and interact with an SQLite database. The database operations are performed directly in Python code without the need for a separate database server.

SQLite is suitable for small-scale applications, prototyping, and scenarios where you want a self-contained database solution without the overhead of a separate server process. If you need more advanced features, scalability, or concurrent access, you might consider using other relational database management systems like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server.
