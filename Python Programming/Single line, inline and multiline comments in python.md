In Python, comments are used to add explanatory notes, annotations, or documentation to your code. They are ignored by the Python interpreter and are not executed as part of the program. There are three types of comments you can use in Python: single-line comments, inline comments, and multiline comments.

1. **Single-Line Comments:**
   Single-line comments are used to add comments on a single line. They start with the `#` character and continue until the end of the line.

   ```python
   # This is a single-line comment
   x = 10  # This is an inline comment
   ```

2. **Inline Comments:**
   Inline comments are comments that appear on the same line as the code they are annotating. They are often used to provide additional context for a specific line of code.

   ```python
   y = 20  # This variable stores the value 20
   ```

3. **Multiline Comments (Docstrings):**
   While Python does not have a syntax for traditional multiline comments, you can use multiline strings (docstrings) to achieve similar functionality. Docstrings are often used to document functions, modules, classes, and methods.

   ```python
   """
   This is a multiline comment (docstring).
   It provides information about the purpose and usage of a function or other code element.
   """
   
   def my_function():
       """This function does something important."""
       # ...
   ```

   Note that docstrings are not ignored by the Python interpreter. They can be accessed using the `__doc__` attribute of functions, classes, and modules.

It's important to use comments effectively to enhance the readability and understanding of your code. Meaningful comments can help you and others understand the purpose and logic of different parts of your program. However, avoid over-commenting or writing comments that merely repeat what the code already says. Keep your comments concise and informative.
