In Python, you can force the use of named parameters (also known as keyword arguments) by defining your function with named parameters and omitting the use of `*args` or positional parameters. Named parameters make the function call more readable and self-explanatory, especially when dealing with functions that have many parameters or default values.

Here's an example of defining a function that requires the use of named parameters:

```python
def calculate_area(width, height):
    return width * height

# Correct usage of named parameters
area = calculate_area(width=5, height=10)
print(area)  # Output: 50

# Incorrect usage of positional parameters (will result in a TypeError)
# area = calculate_area(5, 10)
```

In this example, the `calculate_area()` function takes two named parameters, `width` and `height`. When calling the function, you must explicitly specify the parameter names along with their values. Attempting to use positional parameters will result in a `TypeError` because the function expects named parameters.

By using named parameters, you improve the readability and maintainability of your code, especially when the function has multiple parameters with default values or when there's potential for confusion due to the order of the parameters.
