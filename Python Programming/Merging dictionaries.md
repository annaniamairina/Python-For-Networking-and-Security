You can merge dictionaries in Python using various techniques, depending on the version of Python you're using and your specific requirements. Here are a few ways to merge dictionaries:

**1. Using the `update()` Method:**
The `update()` method can be used to merge one dictionary into another. If the dictionaries have overlapping keys, the values from the second dictionary will overwrite the values from the first dictionary.

```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}

dict1.update(dict2)

print(dict1)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

**2. Using Dictionary Unpacking (Python 3.5+):**
You can use the unpacking operator (`**`) to merge dictionaries.

```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}

merged_dict = {**dict1, **dict2}

print(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

**3. Using Dictionary Comprehension (Python 3.5+):**
You can merge dictionaries using dictionary comprehension.

```python
dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}

merged_dict = {k: v for d in (dict1, dict2) for k, v in d.items()}

print(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 3, 'c': 4}
```

**4. Using the `collections.ChainMap` (Python 3.3+):**
The `ChainMap` from the `collections` module allows you to combine multiple dictionaries into a single mapping.

```python
from collections import ChainMap

dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}

merged_dict = dict(ChainMap(dict1, dict2))

print(merged_dict)  # Output: {'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 4}
```

Choose the method that best suits your needs, considering factors such as key conflicts and the version of Python you are using. Each approach has its own advantages and use cases.
