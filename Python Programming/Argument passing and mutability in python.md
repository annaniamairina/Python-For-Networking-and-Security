Argument passing and mutability are important concepts to understand when working with functions and mutable objects in Python.

**Argument Passing:**

In Python, function arguments can be passed by value or reference, depending on the type of object being passed.

1. **Passing Immutable Objects (e.g., int, float, tuple):**
   Immutable objects are passed by value. Changes made to the parameter within the function do not affect the original object outside the function.

   ```python
   def modify_number(x):
       x = x + 1
       print("Inside function:", x)

   num = 5
   modify_number(num)
   print("Outside function:", num)
   ```

2. **Passing Mutable Objects (e.g., list, dictionary, set):**
   Mutable objects are passed by reference. Changes made to the parameter within the function affect the original object outside the function.

   ```python
   def modify_list(lst):
       lst.append(10)
       print("Inside function:", lst)

   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   modify_list(my_list)
   print("Outside function:", my_list)
   ```

**Mutability:**

In Python, objects are classified as mutable or immutable based on whether their value can be changed after creation.

1. **Mutable Objects:** Objects whose value can be changed after creation are called mutable. Lists, dictionaries, and sets are examples of mutable objects.

   ```python
   my_list = [1, 2, 3]
   my_list.append(4)
   ```

2. **Immutable Objects:** Objects whose value cannot be changed after creation are called immutable. Integers, strings, and tuples are examples of immutable objects.

   ```python
   my_string = "Hello"
   my_string = my_string + " World"
   ```

It's important to understand the implications of argument passing and mutability to avoid unexpected behavior when working with functions and mutable objects. If you want to modify a mutable object within a function without affecting the original object outside the function, consider making a copy of the object using slicing (`my_list[:]`), `copy()` (for dictionaries), or other appropriate methods.
