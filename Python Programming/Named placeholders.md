Named placeholders in string formatting allow you to provide more descriptive names for the variables you are substituting into the formatted string. This can make your code more readable and help prevent errors when formatting complex strings. Named placeholders are commonly used with f-strings and the `str.format()` method.

Here's how you can use named placeholders:

**Using f-strings (Formatted String Literals):**

```python
name = "Alice"
age = 30

formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old."
print(formatted_string)
```

**Using `str.format()` Method with Named Placeholders:**

```python
name = "Bob"
age = 25

formatted_string = "My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.".format(name=name, age=age)
print(formatted_string)
```

**Combining Named and Regular Placeholders:**

You can use a mix of regular and named placeholders within the same string.

```python
name = "Charlie"
age = 28

formatted_string = f"My name is {name} and I am {age} years old. {name}'s age is {age}."
print(formatted_string)
```

Named placeholders are especially useful when you have many variables to format within a string or when the order of the variables might change in the future. They make your code more self-explanatory and easier to maintain.

Remember that f-strings provide a more concise and modern way to work with named placeholders, so if you're using Python 3.6 or later, consider using f-strings for a cleaner and more readable syntax.
