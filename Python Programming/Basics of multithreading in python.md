Multithreading in Python allows you to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently within a single process. This can be useful for improving the responsiveness of applications, particularly when dealing with I/O-bound tasks. Python provides the `threading` module for working with multithreading. Here's a basic introduction to multithreading in Python:

1. **Import the `threading` Module:**

   Import the `threading` module at the beginning of your script:

   ```python
   import threading
   ```

2. **Create a Thread:**

   Define a function that you want to run in a separate thread. Then, create a `Thread` object and provide the target function:

   ```python
   def print_numbers():
       for i in range(1, 6):
           print("Number:", i)

   thread = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
   ```

3. **Start the Thread:**

   Start the thread using the `start()` method. This will execute the target function concurrently:

   ```python
   thread.start()
   ```

4. **Join the Thread:**

   Use the `join()` method to wait for the thread to finish executing before proceeding with the main program:

   ```python
   thread.join()
   ```

5. **Creating Multiple Threads:**

   You can create and run multiple threads by creating multiple `Thread` objects and starting them:

   ```python
   def print_letters():
       for letter in ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E']:
           print("Letter:", letter)

   thread1 = threading.Thread(target=print_numbers)
   thread2 = threading.Thread(target=print_letters)

   thread1.start()
   thread2.start()

   thread1.join()
   thread2.join()
   ```

Remember that Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the true parallelism of threads in certain situations, particularly for CPU-bound tasks. If you're dealing with CPU-bound tasks, consider using the `multiprocessing` module instead.

Multithreading is most effective for I/O-bound tasks where threads can perform useful work while waiting for I/O operations to complete (such as reading/writing files or making network requests). Be cautious when using multithreading for CPU-bound tasks, as the GIL may limit the performance improvement you can achieve.
