In Python, the `array` module provides a data structure called `array` which is similar to lists but stores elements of a single data type. To add items from a list to an `array`, you can use the `fromlist()` method. Here's how you can use it:

First, you need to import the `array` module:

```python
from array import array
```

Then, you can create an `array` and use the `fromlist()` method to add elements from a list:

```python
my_array = array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])
my_list = [5, 6, 7]

my_array.fromlist(my_list)
```

In this example, the `array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4])` creates an integer array with initial values `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the `fromlist()` method adds the elements from the `my_list` list (`[5, 6, 7]`) to the array. After using `fromlist()`, the `my_array` will contain `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Please note that the `fromlist()` method modifies the `array` in place and does not return a new `array`. It is specific to the `array` data structure and cannot be used with Python's built-in `list`.
