Defining a function with multiple arguments in Python is straightforward. You can define a function with any number of parameters, including zero, one, or more. Here's how you can define a function with multiple arguments:

```python
def add(x, y):
    result = x + y
    return result

sum_result = add(5, 3)
print(sum_result)  # Output: 8
```

In the example above, the function `add()` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`. You can pass values to these parameters when you call the function.

You can also have functions with more than two parameters:

```python
def calculate_sum(a, b, c):
    total = a + b + c
    return total

result = calculate_sum(10, 20, 30)
print(result)  # Output: 60
```

If you have a function with many parameters or you want to make your function more flexible, you can use default values for some or all of the parameters:

```python
def power(base, exponent=2):
    result = base ** exponent
    return result

square = power(5)
cube = power(3, 3)

print(square)  # Output: 25
print(cube)    # Output: 27
```

In this example, the `power()` function has a default value of `2` for the `exponent` parameter. You can still pass a different value for `exponent` when calling the function.

Remember, the order of the parameters in the function definition must match the order in which you provide the values when calling the function. You can also use named parameters (keyword arguments) to make your function calls more explicit and self-explanatory.
