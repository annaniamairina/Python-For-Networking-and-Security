Recursive lambda functions in Python are not straightforward due to the limitations of lambda expressions, which do not support multi-line code or direct recursion. However, you can achieve a form of recursion using a technique called "Y combinator" or "fixed-point combinator."

Here's how you can define a recursive lambda function using the Y combinator technique:

```python
# Define the Y combinator
Y = (lambda f: lambda x: x(x))(lambda y: f(lambda *args: y(y)(*args)))

# Define a recursive lambda function for factorial
factorial = Y(lambda f: lambda n: 1 if n == 0 else n * f(n - 1))

# Test the recursive lambda function
print(factorial(5))  # Output: 120
```

In this example, the `Y` combinator is a higher-order function that takes a function `f` and returns a new function that enables recursion. You can then define your recursive lambda function (`factorial`) by using the `Y` combinator.

Please note that this approach, while interesting, is not very idiomatic or common in Python. Recursive functions are typically defined using the `def` keyword, and lambda functions are usually used for simpler, one-liner expressions. If you require recursion, it's generally recommended to use a regular `def` function.
