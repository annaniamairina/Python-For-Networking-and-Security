You can run two simple processes concurrently in Python using the `multiprocessing` module. This module allows you to create and manage multiple processes, each of which can execute code independently. Here's a basic example of running two processes concurrently:

```python
import multiprocessing
import time

# Function to run in the first process
def process_one():
    for _ in range(5):
        print("Process One")
        time.sleep(1)

# Function to run in the second process
def process_two():
    for _ in range(5):
        print("Process Two")
        time.sleep(1)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create two process objects
    process1 = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_one)
    process2 = multiprocessing.Process(target=process_two)
    
    # Start both processes
    process1.start()
    process2.start()
    
    # Wait for both processes to finish
    process1.join()
    process2.join()
    
    print("Both processes have finished")
```

In this example:

- We import the `multiprocessing` module and the `time` module.
- We define two functions `process_one` and `process_two` that will be run in separate processes.
- Inside each function, we use a loop to print a message and then sleep for 1 second to simulate some work.
- In the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block, we create two process objects using the `Process` class and provide the target functions to be executed.
- We start both processes using the `start()` method.
- We use the `join()` method to wait for both processes to finish before printing a final message.

Keep in mind that the `multiprocessing` module is suited for CPU-bound tasks. If you are working with I/O-bound tasks (such as making network requests or reading/writing files), you might want to explore the `concurrent.futures` module, which provides a higher-level interface for managing concurrent tasks.

Additionally, please note that the behavior of running multiple processes may vary based on your operating system and Python interpreter. The example above is intended to illustrate the concept of concurrent processes and may need adjustments based on your specific use case.
