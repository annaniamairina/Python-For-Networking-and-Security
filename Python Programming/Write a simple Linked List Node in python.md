Sure! Here's a simple implementation of a singly linked list node in Python:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

# Create some nodes
node1 = Node(10)
node2 = Node(20)
node3 = Node(30)

# Link the nodes
node1.next = node2
node2.next = node3

# Access node data and next pointer
print(node1.data)     # Output: 10
print(node1.next.data)  # Output: 20
print(node2.next.data)  # Output: 30
```

In this example, the `Node` class represents a basic singly linked list node. Each node has two attributes: `data` to store the value of the node, and `next` to point to the next node in the list. The `next` attribute is initially set to `None` to indicate the end of the list.

You can create multiple nodes, link them together by setting the `next` pointers, and access the data and next node using the attributes. This is a fundamental building block for implementing more complex linked list structures.
