Python supports a variety of mathematical operators for performing arithmetic operations on numeric values. Here are the basic mathematical operators in Python:

1. **Addition (`+`):**
   Adds two numbers together.

   ```python
   result = 5 + 3
   ```

2. **Subtraction (`-`):**
   Subtracts the second number from the first.

   ```python
   result = 10 - 4
   ```

3. **Multiplication (`*`):**
   Multiplies two numbers.

   ```python
   result = 6 * 7
   ```

4. **Division (`/`):**
   Divides the first number by the second, resulting in a floating-point number.

   ```python
   result = 15 / 3
   ```

5. **Floor Division (`//`):**
   Divides the first number by the second, and rounds down to the nearest integer.

   ```python
   result = 16 // 3  # Result: 5
   ```

6. **Modulus (`%`):**
   Returns the remainder of the division between two numbers.

   ```python
   result = 17 % 5  # Result: 2
   ```

7. **Exponentiation (`**`):**
   Raises the first number to the power of the second.

   ```python
   result = 2 ** 3  # Result: 8
   ```

8. **Negation (`-`):**
   Negates the value of a number.

   ```python
   result = -5
   ```

9. **Assignment with Arithmetic (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `//=`, `%=`):**
   Performs an arithmetic operation and assigns the result to a variable.

   ```python
   num = 10
   num += 2  # Equivalent to num = num + 2
   ```

These are the basic mathematical operators in Python. You can combine these operators and use parentheses to perform more complex calculations. Keep in mind the order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) when working with multiple operators in an expression.
