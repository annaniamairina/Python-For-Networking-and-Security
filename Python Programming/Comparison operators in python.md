Comparison operators in Python are used to compare two values and determine the relationship between them. These operators return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on whether the comparison is true or false. Here are the comparison operators in Python:

1. **Equal to (`==`):**
   Checks if two values are equal.

   ```python
   x == y  # Returns True if x is equal to y, otherwise False
   ```

2. **Not equal to (`!=`):**
   Checks if two values are not equal.

   ```python
   x != y  # Returns True if x is not equal to y, otherwise False
   ```

3. **Greater than (`>`):**
   Checks if the left value is greater than the right value.

   ```python
   x > y   # Returns True if x is greater than y, otherwise False
   ```

4. **Less than (`<`):**
   Checks if the left value is less than the right value.

   ```python
   x < y   # Returns True if x is less than y, otherwise False
   ```

5. **Greater than or equal to (`>=`):**
   Checks if the left value is greater than or equal to the right value.

   ```python
   x >= y  # Returns True if x is greater than or equal to y, otherwise False
   ```

6. **Less than or equal to (`<=`):**
   Checks if the left value is less than or equal to the right value.

   ```python
   x <= y  # Returns True if x is less than or equal to y, otherwise False
   ```

You can use these comparison operators to create boolean expressions that evaluate the relationship between values. For example:

```python
x = 5
y = 10
result = x < y  # True, because 5 is less than 10
```

Comparison operators are often used in conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`), loops, and other situations where you need to make decisions based on the comparison of values.
