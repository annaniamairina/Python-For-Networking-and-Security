Subtracting months from a date accurately in Python requires a bit more attention due to the varying number of days in different months and the possibility of crossing year boundaries. One way to achieve this is by using the `dateutil.relativedelta` class from the `dateutil` library, which provides a more flexible approach to working with date differences involving months. Here's how you can subtract months from a date accurately:

1. **Install the `dateutil` Library:**
   If you haven't already, install the `dateutil` library using `pip`:

   ```bash
   pip install python-dateutil
   ```

2. **Import the Required Modules:**
   Import the necessary modules for working with dates and date differences:

   ```python
   from datetime import datetime
   from dateutil.relativedelta import relativedelta
   ```

3. **Subtract Months from a Date:**
   Use the `relativedelta` class to accurately subtract months from a date:

   ```python
   # Original date
   original_date = datetime(2023, 8, 31)

   # Number of months to subtract
   months_to_subtract = 3

   # Subtract months using relativedelta
   new_date = original_date - relativedelta(months=months_to_subtract)

   print("Original Date:", original_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
   print("New Date:", new_date.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
   ```

The `relativedelta` class handles the complexities of subtracting months accurately, taking into account the varying lengths of months and potential year changes. This approach ensures that you get a valid and accurate date result.

Keep in mind that the `dateutil` library is a third-party library, so you need to install it separately. Using `relativedelta` provides a more robust solution compared to attempting to manually adjust the date by subtracting a fixed number of days, especially when dealing with date differences that involve months.
