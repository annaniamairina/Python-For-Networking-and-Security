In Python, lists are a versatile data structure that supports a variety of methods and operators for manipulating and working with lists. Here's a list of some commonly used list methods and supported operators:

**List Methods:**

1. `append(element)`: Adds an element to the end of the list.
2. `extend(iterable)`: Adds elements from an iterable to the end of the list.
3. `insert(index, element)`: Inserts an element at a specified index.
4. `remove(element)`: Removes the first occurrence of a specified element.
5. `pop(index=-1)`: Removes and returns the element at the specified index (default is the last element).
6. `index(element, start=0, end=len(list))`: Returns the index of the first occurrence of an element within the specified range.
7. `count(element)`: Returns the number of occurrences of an element in the list.
8. `sort(key=None, reverse=False)`: Sorts the list in place (ascending by default, or descending if `reverse=True`).
9. `reverse()`: Reverses the order of elements in the list.
10. `copy()`: Creates a shallow copy of the list.
11. `clear()`: Removes all elements from the list.

**List Operators:**

1. `+`: Concatenates two lists.
2. `*`: Replicates a list by a specified number of times.
3. `in`: Checks if an element is present in the list.
4. `not in`: Checks if an element is not present in the list.
5. `len(list)`: Returns the number of elements in the list.
6. Indexing (`list[index]`): Accesses an element at the specified index.
7. Slicing (`list[start:end]`): Extracts a sublist within the specified range.

**List Comprehensions:**

List comprehensions provide a concise way to create new lists by applying an expression to each element of an existing iterable (such as a list).

```python
squared = [x**2 for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]]  # [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

Python's built-in `list()` function can convert other iterable types (e.g., tuples, strings) into lists:

```python
my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
my_list = list(my_tuple)
```

These are just a subset of the methods, operators, and techniques available for working with lists in Python. Lists are fundamental data structures in Python, and their versatile functionality makes them a powerful tool for various programming tasks.
