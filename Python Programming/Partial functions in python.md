Partial functions in Python are a powerful feature provided by the `functools` module that allow you to create new functions based on existing functions with some arguments fixed or pre-set. This is particularly useful when you have a function that you want to use multiple times with certain arguments already provided. Partial functions simplify the process of creating specialized functions from more general ones.

Here's how you can use partial functions in Python:

**Example: Using `functools.partial`**

```python
import functools

def power(base, exponent):
    return base ** exponent

# Create a partial function with fixed exponent
square = functools.partial(power, exponent=2)

result = square(5)  # Equivalent to calling power(5, 2)
print(result)  # Output: 25
```

In this example, the `functools.partial` function is used to create a new function `square` based on the `power` function. The `exponent` argument is fixed to `2`, so you only need to provide the `base` argument when calling `square`.

**Real-World Example:**

Partial functions are particularly useful when working with functions that take multiple arguments, and you want to simplify their usage by fixing some arguments.

```python
from functools import partial

def greet(greeting, name):
    return f"{greeting}, {name}!"

# Create a partial function for a specific greeting
greet_hello = partial(greet, "Hello")
greet_hi = partial(greet, "Hi")

print(greet_hello("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(greet_hi("Bob"))       # Output: Hi, Bob!
```

In this example, the partial functions `greet_hello` and `greet_hi` are created from the `greet` function, fixing the `greeting` argument.

Partial functions can be especially useful for creating more readable and expressive code by reducing the need for repetitive arguments in function calls.
