It seems there might be some confusion here. In Python, the `array` module's `array` data structure doesn't have a `remove()` method like the built-in `list` data structure does. The `array` type is more restricted and optimized for storing elements of a single data type, and it doesn't provide methods like `remove()`.

If you want to remove elements from an `array`-like structure, you typically have to use slicing or other methods. However, if you want to remove elements from a regular Python list, you can use the `remove()` method. Here's how it works:

```python
my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 5]

# Remove the first occurrence of the value 3
my_list.remove(3)

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 4, 3, 5]
```

In this example, the `remove()` method is used to remove the first occurrence of the value `3` from the list. After calling `remove()`, the list becomes `[1, 2, 4, 3, 5]`.

If you're specifically using the `array` module and its `array` type, you won't be able to use the `remove()` method directly. Instead, you might need to work with array slicing, filtering, or other methods to achieve the desired element removal. If you're working with regular lists, the `remove()` method provides a convenient way to remove elements based on their value.
