To write data to a CSV file from a string or a list in Python, you can use the `csv` module, which provides functionality to work with CSV files. Here's how you can write data to a CSV file using both strings and lists:

1. **Writing from a String:**

```python
import csv

data_string = "John,Doe,30\nAlice,Smith,25\nBob,Johnson,28"

# Split the string into lines and create a list of lists
data_list = [line.split(',') for line in data_string.split('\n')]

# Write the data to a CSV file
with open('data_from_string.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data_list)
```

2. **Writing from a List of Lists:**

```python
import csv

data_list = [
    ['John', 'Doe', 30],
    ['Alice', 'Smith', 25],
    ['Bob', 'Johnson', 28]
]

# Write the data to a CSV file
with open('data_from_list.csv', 'w', newline='') as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerows(data_list)
```

In both examples:

- The `csv.writer()` function is used to create a CSV writer object.
- The `writerows()` method is used to write the data to the CSV file.
- The `newline=''` parameter in the `open()` function ensures that the CSV file is written with the correct line endings.

After running the code, you'll have two CSV files (`data_from_string.csv` and `data_from_list.csv`) in your current directory, each containing the data you provided.

Make sure to adjust the data and file paths according to your requirements. Additionally, you can customize the delimiter, quote characters, and other settings using the `csv` module's options.
