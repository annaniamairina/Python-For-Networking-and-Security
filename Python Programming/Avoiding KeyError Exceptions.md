To avoid `KeyError` exceptions when working with dictionaries in Python, you can use various techniques to check if a key exists in the dictionary before trying to access its value. Here are some common approaches:

1. **Using the `in` Operator:**
   You can use the `in` operator to check if a key exists in the dictionary before accessing its value.

   ```python
   my_dict = {"name": "John", "age": 30}

   if "name" in my_dict:
       print(my_dict["name"])
   else:
       print("Key not found")
   ```

2. **Using the `get()` Method:**
   The `get()` method allows you to retrieve the value associated with a key, and it also provides a default value if the key is not found.

   ```python
   name = my_dict.get("name", "Default Name")
   ```

3. **Using a Try-Except Block:**
   You can use a `try`-`except` block to catch the `KeyError` exception and handle it gracefully.

   ```python
   try:
       print(my_dict["name"])
   except KeyError:
       print("Key not found")
   ```

4. **Using the `defaultdict` from the `collections` Module:**
   The `defaultdict` provides a way to specify a default value for missing keys.

   ```python
   from collections import defaultdict

   my_dict = defaultdict(lambda: "Default Value")
   print(my_dict["name"])
   ```

5. **Using the `dict.get()` Method with a Default Value:**
   The `dict.get()` method can be used to provide a default value if the key is not found.

   ```python
   name = my_dict.get("name", "Default Name")
   ```

Choose the approach that best fits your specific use case. Each technique has its advantages, and the choice depends on the desired behavior and the structure of your code.
