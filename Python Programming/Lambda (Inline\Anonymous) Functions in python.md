Lambda functions, also known as inline or anonymous functions, are a way to create small, simple functions without explicitly defining a function using the `def` keyword. Lambda functions are often used for short, throwaway operations where creating a full function definition would be unnecessary.

The syntax for a lambda function is:
```python
lambda arguments: expression
```

Here's an example of using lambda functions:

```python
# Regular function
def square(x):
    return x ** 2

print(square(5))  # Output: 25

# Equivalent lambda function
square_lambda = lambda x: x ** 2
print(square_lambda(5))  # Output: 25
```

Lambda functions are commonly used with built-in functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, as well as in situations where you need to pass a small function as an argument to another function.

**Using Lambda with `map()` and `filter()`:**

```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Using map() with lambda to square each element
squared_numbers = list(map(lambda x: x ** 2, numbers))
print(squared_numbers)  # Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]

# Using filter() with lambda to filter even numbers
even_numbers = list(filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, numbers))
print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]
```

While lambda functions are useful for concise and quick operations, they are not suitable for complex or large functions. For more substantial logic, it's better to use regular named functions defined with `def` for clarity and maintainability.
