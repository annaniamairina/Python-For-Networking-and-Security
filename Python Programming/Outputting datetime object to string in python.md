To convert a `datetime` object to a formatted string in Python, you can use the `strftime()` method of the `datetime` class. This method allows you to specify a format string that defines how the `datetime` components should be represented in the output string. Here's how you can output a `datetime` object to a string:

```python
from datetime import datetime

# Create a datetime object
my_datetime = datetime(2023, 8, 11, 15, 30, 0)

# Format the datetime object as a string
formatted_string = my_datetime.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

print("Formatted datetime string:", formatted_string)
```

In the example above, we used the `%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S` format string to represent the `datetime` object as "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS". The format codes used in the format string have special meanings and are replaced by the corresponding `datetime` components when the string is formatted.

Here are some commonly used format codes:

- `%Y`: Year with century as a decimal number.
- `%m`: Month as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%d`: Day of the month as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%H`: Hour (24-hour clock) as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%M`: Minute as a zero-padded decimal number.
- `%S`: Second as a zero-padded decimal number.

You can combine these format codes and add additional characters to create the desired output format.

Keep in mind that the `strftime()` method is used for formatting `datetime` objects to strings. If you need to parse a string into a `datetime` object, you can use the `strptime()` function, as shown in previous responses.
