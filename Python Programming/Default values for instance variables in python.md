In Python, you can provide default values for instance variables in the `__init__` method of a class. Instance variables are attributes that are unique to each instance of a class. By assigning default values in the constructor, you can ensure that instances are created with specific initial values for those attributes.

Here's an example of using default values for instance variables:

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age=18):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

# Create instances with and without specifying age
person1 = Person("Alice")
person2 = Person("Bob", 25)

print(person1.name, person1.age)  # Output: Alice 18
print(person2.name, person2.age)  # Output: Bob 25
```

In this example, the `Person` class has an `__init__` method that takes `name` and `age` as arguments, with `age` having a default value of `18`. When you create instances of the class, you can provide values for both `name` and `age`, or just for `name`, in which case `age` will default to `18`.

You can set default values for any instance variables by specifying them as default parameters in the constructor. If an argument is provided during object creation, it will override the default value; otherwise, the default value will be used.

Note that if a mutable object (such as a list or dictionary) is used as a default value, you need to be careful, as changes to that object will affect all instances that use the default. To avoid this, you can use `None` as the default and create a new instance of the mutable object inside the constructor if needed.

```python
class Example:
    def __init__(self, data=None):
        if data is None:
            data = []
        self.data = data
```

Using default values for instance variables can make your code more flexible and reduce the need for providing all arguments when creating instances of a class.
