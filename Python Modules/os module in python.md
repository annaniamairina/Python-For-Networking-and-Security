The `os` module in Python provides a way of interacting with the operating system. It offers a range of functions for performing operations on the file system, working with file paths, and executing system commands. Here are some common tasks and functionalities provided by the `os` module:

1. **Working with File Paths:**
   - `os.path.join(path, *paths)`: Join one or more path components intelligently.
   - `os.path.abspath(path)`: Return the absolute version of a path.
   - `os.path.exists(path)`: Check if a path exists.
   - `os.path.isfile(path)`: Check if a path is a regular file.
   - `os.path.isdir(path)`: Check if a path is a directory.

   ```python
   import os

   path = os.path.join("folder", "file.txt")
   absolute_path = os.path.abspath(path)

   if os.path.exists(absolute_path):
       print(f"{absolute_path} exists.")
       if os.path.isfile(absolute_path):
           print(f"{absolute_path} is a file.")
       elif os.path.isdir(absolute_path):
           print(f"{absolute_path} is a directory.")
   else:
       print(f"{absolute_path} does not exist.")
   ```

2. **Directory Operations:**
   - `os.mkdir(path)`: Create a directory.
   - `os.makedirs(path, exist_ok=True)`: Create a directory and its parent directories if they don't exist.
   - `os.rmdir(path)`: Remove a directory.
   - `os.removedirs(path)`: Remove a directory and its empty parent directories.

   ```python
   import os

   os.makedirs("parent/child/grandchild", exist_ok=True)

   # Perform operations on the created directory

   os.removedirs("parent/child/grandchild")
   ```

3. **File Operations:**
   - `os.rename(src, dst)`: Rename a file or directory.
   - `os.remove(path)`: Remove a file.
   - `os.listdir(path='.')`: Return a list containing the names of the entries in the directory.

   ```python
   import os

   os.rename("old_name.txt", "new_name.txt")
   os.remove("file_to_remove.txt")

   files = os.listdir()
   print("Files in the current directory:", files)
   ```

4. **Executing System Commands:**
   - `os.system(command)`: Execute the command in a subshell.
   - `os.popen(command)`: Open a pipe to or from a command.

   ```python
   import os

   os.system("echo Hello, World!")
   result = os.popen("dir").read()
   print(result)
   ```

5. **Environment Variables:**
   - `os.environ`: A mapping object representing the environment variables.

   ```python
   import os

   print("PATH environment variable:", os.environ.get("PATH"))
   ```

These are just a few examples of what you can do with the `os` module. It's a powerful module for interacting with the operating system and performing file and directory-related operations.
